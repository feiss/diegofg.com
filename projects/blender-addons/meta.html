<h3>MOZ_Text</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/feiss/MOZ_text">GitHub</a> /
<a href="https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/MOZ_text/test/index.html">Test scene</a>

<p>This is an extension for glTF to support text objects.</p>

<p>The aim is not to save the mesh but only metadata about the content, font and text properties, so it is in the final application the decision of how to interpret and render it.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal would be to have a perfect match between Blender (or other 3d package) and the render engine, but given the multiple differences of how text is handled in all the steps, further work is required. This project aims to a very practical approach: to have a useful tool that we can use today for simple use cases.</p>
